calcium bateries with green indicator are the best.

Most bateries at sale in market are damaged goods, about 80%, 
therefore need luck if buying in normal hypermarkets, they steal the consumers
by selling out of date or end of life producta that will not perform not even 20%
of normal usage. Therefore stay in the known good brand and a "reliable" and
"honest" supplier if there is such a thing.
