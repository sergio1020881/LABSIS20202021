Commercially available solar trackers include single-axis tracking which tracks 
the sun across the sky during each day at a fixed constant tilt angle. 
This increases the solar radiation received by up to 25-30% compared to no tracking.
Twin or dual-axis tracking, tracks the sun across the sky during each day but also 
adjusts the tilt angle of the array more in winter and less in summer to accurately 
locate the position of the sun in the sky. Dual-axis tracking increase the solar 
radiation received by up to 33-38% compared to no tracking. Sunnier locations 
benefit more from dual-axis tracking.
This advice applies to any type of panel that gets energy from the sun; 
photovoltaic, solar hot water, etc. We assume that the panel is fixed, or has a 
tilt that can be adjusted seasonally. (Panels that track the movement of the sun 
throughout the day can receive 10% (in winter) to 40% (in summer) more energy than 
fixed panels. This page doesn’t discuss tracking panels.)
But because the sun is higher in the summer and lower in the winter, you can 
capture more energy during the whole year by adjusting the tilt of the panels 
according to the season. The following table shows the effect of adjusting the angle, 
using a system at 40° latitude as an example. (The comparison would be a little 
different for different latitudes.) Each option is compared with the energy received 
by the best possible tracker that always keeps the panel pointed directly at the sun.

Also, if you live where there is snow, adjusting the panels to a steeper angle in 
winter makes it more likely that they will shed snow. A panel covered in snow produces 
little or no power.
